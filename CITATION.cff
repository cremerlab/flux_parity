abstract: >-
  Effective coordination of cellular processes is critical
  to ensure the competitive growth of microbial organisms.
  Pivotal to this coordination is the appropriate
  partitioning of cellular resources between protein
  synthesis via translation and the metabolism needed to
  sustain it. Here, we extend a low-dimensional allocation
  model to describe the dynamic regulation of this resource
  partitioning. At the core of this regulation is the
  optimal coordination of metabolic and translational
  fluxes, mechanistically achieved via the perception of
  charged- and uncharged-tRNA turnover. An extensive
  comparison with â‰ˆ 60 data sets from Escherichia coli
  establishes this regulatory mechanism's biological
  veracity and demonstrates that a remarkably wide range of
  growth phenomena in and out of steady state can be
  predicted with quantitative accuracy. This predictive
  power, achieved with only a few biological parameters,
  cements the preeminent importance of optimal flux
  regulation across conditions and establishes
  low-dimensional allocation models as an ideal
  physiological framework to interrogate the dynamics of
  growth, competition, and adaptation in complex and
  ever-changing environments.
